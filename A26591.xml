            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat Reaſon poor Mankind hath to take care of himſelf, let any Judg, ſince he hath Three ſuch Potent Enemies to Encounter, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> they being ſo conſiderable, that our Divines have thought it in all Ages their principal Care and Endeavours to prompt all people to a ſerious and ſtrict conſideration of them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Evil, the conqueſt of them being of more eſteem and value then that of Kingdoms.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99008:3"/>
            <p>But ſince we find by ſad and woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the unhappy miſtake of our firſt Parents and Original, that without the aſſiſtance and Protection of Almighty God, and Merits of his Bleſſed Son, we are liable to all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their unhappy miſcarriage, (let us beg his Aſſiſtance to prevent) to take warning by the ſad Examples of others (not only their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but Actions) of which by a moſt ſad and dreadful Relation I ſhall give you an Account from the Spectators of this Bloody Tragedy begot by Drunkenneſs and Adultery.</p>
            <p>The wife of this <hi>William Dennis</hi> the Murtherer, (who was a Literman) from what Reaſon I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly Learn, but ſuppoſed from the true cauſe of Jealouſy, found him in Bed with a lewd woman on <hi>May</hi> day, ſhe was one that uſed to cry <hi>Strong-water</hi> about the Streets, (the common firſt occaſion) of the ſucceeding Sin.</p>
            <p>From whence (as juſtly it might) begot great diſcontent and ſtrife between them, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the poor woman ſeveral ſevere <hi>Baſtinadoes,</hi> which grew to ſuch a degree, that the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood took notice of it.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99008:3"/>
            <p>But more particularly on this Fatal day, the fifteenth Inſtant, when he going abroad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home drunk, and abuſing his wife as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, occaſined not only the whole Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but Paſſengers, who came to hinder the miſchief deſign'd his wife, but he being as full of miſchief as drink, without any conſideration or occaſion, wickedly Swore he would Kill the next Man, which he villanouſly performed upon the body of one <hi>Thomas Gately</hi> a Tubman, an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Spectator, by wounding him in the Groin with a half pike, of which he immediately died.</p>
            <p>VVhich being done as if he had been Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſtupid, returns to his own Houſe, and throws in the aforeſaid half pike, after which he endeavoured a ſeeming eſcape, but Vengeance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him, he was ſoon ſtopt to give an account of his prodigious Murther, to which purpoſe he was carried before Juſtice <hi>Wood,</hi> who being not at home, was tranſmitted to Juſtice <hi>Rycrofts,</hi> but no body being there at preſent, who were Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of the Murther, and the great diſorder he was in by drinking, he was reſpited for ſome time.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99008:4"/>
            <p>But afterwards upon a ſtict examination the Horridneſs of the fact which was highly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by his wilfulneſs and ſtubbornneſs being proved by the ſtrength of the Evidence, He was by the Common Guard of the Conſtable and his aſſiſtance eaſily convey'd to <hi>New-Gate,</hi> from <hi>whence</hi> he muſt expect the Juſt reward of his Errour.</p>
            <p>But 'tis feared this ſad Tragedy will not end in this one perſon, for beſides his Wife who is cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maimed by him, and whoſe Life is much ſuſpected, the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Murthered Party, who having been lately brought to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99008:4"/>Bed, hearing of the untimely and unexpected loſs of her dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being Tranſported into a paſſion begot by affection and Nature, forgetting all care of her ſelf, and contrary to the uſe of Women in that condition, runs out of her Chamber, Imbraces the Corps of her Dead Father from which ſhe could not be diſingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any intreaties or perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till ſuch time as 'tis fear'd the danger ſhe ran hath deſtroyed her, I hope this ſad warning will be a Juſt occaſion to deter all People from committing ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and make them ſtand upon their Guards, and make them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
